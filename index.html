        <h2>About Us</h2>
        
            <h3>Service 1: Sales spot - each end-customer pays</h3>
            <p>Perfume Vending Solutions offers quick, convenient access to a variety of high-quality fragrances. Simply pay per spray to try a premium scent on the go, without buying a full bottle. You can find our machines in high-traffic areas like malls and airports for easy, affordable access to your favorite perfumes.</p>
        
            <h3>Service 2: Service spot - location pays, full service</h3>
            <p>Perfume Vending Solutions provides a full-service fragrance experience for businesses at no upfront cost. We install and maintain perfume vending machines at your location, offering a range of scents for your customers. You simply pay a service fee based on a tiered pricing model (e.g., 50 sprays for X euros), while we handle the rest—ensuring an added value for your customers with minimal effort.</p>
        
            <h3>Service 3: Service spot - location pays, machine only</h3>
            <p>Perfume Vending Solutions offers a "machine-only" service for businesses that want to manage their own perfume inventory. We provide and maintain the vending machine for a rental fee, and you handle utilities and stocking perfumes. In addition to offering fragrances to your customers, you can also generate extra income by selling ad space on the machine.</p>
 
        <p>We bring you premium perfumes at the touch of a button. Our vending machines are designed to provide a quick, convenient, and luxurious experience.</p>
